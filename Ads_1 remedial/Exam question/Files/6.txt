he heard the miller talking about his daughter the miller was saying that his daughter was the most amazing girl in their village if not in all the landyou there said the king what is so amazing about your daughterthe father bowed he said your majesty my daughter is so clever that she can spin straw into goldspin straw into gold said the king that is amazing she must come to my palace i will put her to the testbut i mean said the miller he wished he had not told the king such a thing but now it was too lateso the millers daughter had to go to the kings palace at once the king took her to a room piled with straw from floor to ceiling he pointed to the spinning wheel in the middle of the room he said now get to work if by morning you have not spun this straw into gold you will diethe king slammed the door and locked it behind him the girl was all alone for the life of her she did not know what to do she had no idea how to spin straw into gold what will i do she called out to the air no

not know if she should trust this strangerwhat you give must be important to you said the imp how about that necklacethe girl thought indeed my necklace is very dear to me but not as much as my freedom so she said to the imp very well if by morning you can turn this room full of straw into gold this necklace is yoursnbspwhat matters is that i can save your life for a price of course the little man got to work very busy he was all night long whirr whirr whirr until morning by then not one piece of straw was left in the room all of it was turned into piles of pure gold thread you did

on your fingeri always loved that ring thought the girl but after all it is just a ring all right she said to the imp its a dealso the imp spun the straw all night by morning nothing but piles of spun gold thread lay on the floor the girl gave the ring to the imp as she said she would dothe next morning the girl felt sure the king would be so happy he would let her go home but alas if two rooms of gold look good to a king three rooms of gold looked even better the king took the girl to the biggest room yet he had already filled with straw he told her she must turn that straw into gold by morning or elsethis time however the king said his son was coming back from a long journey that very night in the morning he would send his son to the room to see if the work was done if it was she was to marry the prince the king thought even if she is a millers daughter i could not find a better wife for my son but he told the girl in a loud booming voice if she could not do the task she would marry no one at all for she would dienbsp he told her she must turn that straw into gold by morning or else when the king left the girl fell into a deep gloom how long would this go on would she ever get out when she lifted her head there was that little man again i bet you knew i would come back he saidi could not know for sure said the girl but this time i no longer have anything to give you i cannot pay you anymorewe will find a good price said the imp and he went to work spinning the straw into goldstop said the girl please i have nothing left to pay youbut the imp did not stop he worked all night long though the girl waved at him and begged him to stop hour after hour it was no useby morning the job was done there said the imp all done now i will tell you my pricethats not fair said the girllots of things are not fair said the imp with a shrugvery well she sighed what is your priceoh nothing right now he said but later if you become queen i will take your first born childwhat said the girl in fear i cannot imagine i would ever be queen but even if i were i would never agree to such a thing there said the imp all done now i will tell you my price oh but you already have the straw is spun into gold and so the deal is made said the imp and he was gonea moment later a young man stepped into the room miss are you all right said the prince i know how hard my father can betrue that she said and they smiled this young man seemed very different from his father when i am king he said i will not rule as he does the prince looked around he saw the large piles of gold shining on the floorhow can you do such a thing he said in wonder the girl said nothing i was told that if the straw were spun into gold by this morning you were to marry me but know this if you really want to get out of here i will help you do not worry i will find a way to tell my fatherthis young man was very different the girl wanted to get to know him better the two stayed in the room and talked about all sorts of things before long they had fallen in love then he asked her to marry him and the girl said yesso the two were married it was not long after the wedding when the terrible old king died the prince became king and the millers daughter became queen in time the new queen had a baby of her own a son joy filled the palace until one day when the queen was alone in the garden all of a sudden the imp stood before her give me what you promised said the imp pointing at the baby nowin time the new queen had a baby of her own a son i never promised it said the queen she held her baby tightly she said i will give you gold instead more gold than you have ever seenwhy do i need gold said the little man i can make all the gold i wanti will give you a castle said the queeni come and go where i want said the imp what do i want with a castlei will give you servants to take care of you said the queenno one takes care of me said the imp no one even knows who i ami will find out who you

days after three days if you cannot tell me my true name the baby is mine but if you guess my name you can keep that baby for all i care and no one must know about this if you say but one word of this to anyone the baby will be gone foreverthree days is a long time to come up with a lot of names thought the queen and so she agreed the next day the queen wrote a very long list of every name she could think of that night in the babys bedroom the imp appeared before her well he said in a loud voicethe queen read the whole list of names one by one could your name be nathan she said lucas jacob hugo felix oliver as you can imagine many other names toonot even close laughed the imp see you tomorrow night and he was gonethe next day the queen looked through every book in the royal library she found names from faraway places names she had never heard of that night when the imp appeared the queen read her list perhaps your name is maximilian she said no how about gunnar alfonso pointdexter and many morethis is boring said the imp but i will not be bored tomorrow night the third night is when that baby is mine he laughed again and was gonethat night when the imp appeared the queen read her list the third day the queen did not know what to do she wished she could tell her husband her woes but she dare not she walked to one side of the room then back again back and forth over and over this does not help a thing she said she put on her royal cape and hood and walked outside the castle if i have peace and quiet maybe i will think of something she thought the queen went into the woods she followed a brook to a big lake and went past the lake to the deep forest hidden in the darknessall of a sudden the queen saw the light of a fire far away and there was a voice that was hard to make out there was something about that voice too but what she stepped closer at last there in front of a fire danced a little man it was he the very same imp very quietly the queen listenedas the little man danced he sang tonight tonight my plans i make tomorrow tomorrow the baby i take the queen will never win the game for rumpelstiltskin is my namerumpelstiltskin said the queenthat night when the imp appeared the queen went through more names is your name yusaf bobek how about salamanno a thousand times no said the imp you are wasting my time i will give you one last guess then that is the endwell i am sure this is not right but could your name be rumpelstiltskinrumpelstiltskin yelled the imp how could you know he was so mad that he stamped his feet he stamped them so hard that a very big hole opened in the ground and he fell right down into it and rumpelstiltskin was never seen again
