two of them were not resting at home they were out shopping for as many fine dresses and hats as they could carry home the youngest daughter beauty loved to read your nose is always in a book her two older sisters said they laughed no one will want you look at your hair you look like a servant girl beauty did not know why they were so mean but she said nothingone day the father got some bad news he had spent all of his money on a ship that he sent out to sea for trade now he learned the ship was gone everything on it was lost all at once the rich father became as poor as poor could be the family could no longer stay in their big house the fine house its fine tables and chairs and all of their fine things had to be sold one day the father got some very bad news all the father had left was a little hut deep in the woods so that is where he and his three daughters had to move living in the hut in the woods was hard work each day a fire had to be started meals cooked the place cleaned up the garden tended and things needed fixing when they broke now that the family was poor you might think the two older sisters would help out think again she looks like such a mess they said turning

light far away he went closer to the light maybe it was a place he could stay for the night when he got up close he saw that it was a large palace with candles in all its windows very odd but the front door was open so the father stepped inside hello he said no answer there before him was a great feast on a long table hello he said again still no answer he dared not touch any food on the table the father sat down in front of the fire to warm himself he waited but no one came i suppose it would be all right if i stayed the night said the father and maybe just one bite he took a quick bite from the feast then he found a bedroom and fell fast asleephello he said no answer the next morning the table was laid again but this time with breakfast again most odd no one was there i suppose i should leave now said the father on the way out he passed a rose garden ah i was to bring beauty a rose he remembered i will take just one and he picked a rose for beautyjust then a loud stomp came up

that is what you saidyes said the beastat the beasts palace the days were long there was no one for beauty to talk to and no books to read every night at nine the beast would come for dinner she would say nothing after all it is not easy to be a prisoner even if you are at a palace the beast would only gruntthen one time at dinner the beast made a little joke and she smiled another time he said something clever and she looked him in the eye after that he would ask her about her day and she would tell him the days were long and there was no one for beauty to talk to one day beauty came to a part of the palace she had not seen before over a door was a sign beautys room the door was open inside the room were shelves of books from the floor to the ceiling there was a piano and a cabinet of fine dresses just her sizenow there was much to talk about at dinner the beast was glad that beauty found the room and liked her surprise one night at the end of dinner beast said beauty i love you will you marry mebeauty did not know what to say beast i have come to like it better here she said talking to you can be the best part of the day but please understand i dont want you to marry youmany times the beast asked her the same question and each time beauty shook her head and said the same thing one night the beast said beauty if you will not marry me what can i do to make you happyif you must know she said it would be to see my father i miss him so muchbeast i have come to like it better here she said talking to you can be the best part of the day but please understand i dont want to marry you the next night the beast gave beauty two magical gifts a mirror and a ring if you want to see your father he said just ask the magic mirror to take you to him when you are ready to come back turn the ring on your finger three times ask the mirror to bring you back here but please do not be gone for more than one week for i will die of griefbeauty was glad to agree when she got back to her room she looked in the magic mirror she asked the mirror to take her to him and there he was in bed right before her yet he looked so sick it was as if he may die but do not be gone for more than one week or i will die of grief such joy her father felt when he looked up and saw beauty for much of what made him sick was knowing that beauty was stuck in the palace all because of him beauty stayed by her fathers bed for many hours she told him that things were not quite so bad at the beasts palace she had all the books she could want to read she had music to play and many fine dresses to wear the beast is really not so bad she said when you get to know him he can be good to talk tobeauty looked around where are my sisters married said her fatherdid they marry good men she saidthey had money said the father but i do not know if your sisters are happy for the eldest sister had married a handsome man who thought of no one but himself and the middle sister had married a man who was very clever but he used his sharp wit to hurt everyone around him and most of all his wifebeauty looked around where are my sisters she said when the sisters came to the house and saw beauty dressed so well and talking about how kind and good the beast was to her they burned with anger beauty told them she must stay no more than one week and the two sisters came up with a plan the sisters petted beauty and said such nice things to her they had never said before when she told them she must go soon they cried they said she must not leave there was still so much left they wanted to do with her and what did it matter anyway just a few more days so beauty stayedone night she had a dream about the beast in her dream the beast lay sick and dying when beauty woke up she asked the magic mirror to show her the beast and there he was in the mirror lying in the rose garden looking so sick he would die at once she turned the magic ring three times take me back to the beast she said in a moment she was sitting next to the poor sick beast who could only gasp for air in her dream the beast lay sick and dying you came back said the beast in a thick voicei am sorry that i am late said beauty i could not bear it that you may not come back to me and now i fear it is too late his eyes closedno cried beauty do not leave me just then she knew in her heart what was true i love you she cried out please come back come back and i will be your wife i will tears rolled down her cheeksjust then the beast opened his eyes beauty he said you did itin a flash the beast was changed to a handsome prince beauty did not know what to thinkah beauty he said and the beast told her his story years ago when he was a prince an evil fairy had put a spell on him he must stay a beast forever until a maiden grew to love him when he still looked like a beast now she had been the one to break the spelland so beauty and her prince formerly the beast were married and they lived happily ever afterend
