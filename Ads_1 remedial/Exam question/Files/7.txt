long ago in england a wise and just king ruled the land his name was king uther times were good and the people lived well king uther wanted a magician at court and so he chose the famous merlin the magician merlin could see into the future and he knew those good days were not going to lastking uther and the queen guinevere had a child a baby son at a castle party for the royal birth merlin the magician took the king aside he said sire there is something you must know soon a great darkness will fall over this land your child is in great danger let me take the baby far away i will be sure he stays safemerlin said the king in surprise you are a great magician and you are my friend but there is no way we would let anyone take our child awaysire there is something you must know sadly soon after the childs birth the queen died not long after king uther was killed in battle that very night merlin swept into the castle and took the child the next morning the royal nurse went into the nursery alas an empty crib in fear the nurse the nobles and servants looked everywhere but the baby was gonefor years there was no king to sit on the throne no king to set the laws men of high rank fought each other to be king darkness fell over the land robbers and bands of wild men ruled the streets of london evil men broke into houses and took what they wanted travelers on the roads were jumped and robbed the people of england lived in fearyet far away there was a quiet place a good knight sir ector lived in peace with his two sons his first son was named kay his younger son arthur had been adopted as a baby years before a stranger had come to sir ector with a baby he asked if sir ector would raise the child the old knight took the baby in his arms glad for a second child he named the baby arthur and raised the child as his ownyet far away there was a quiet place when arthur was ten years old the same stranger returned to sir ectors home he could read and write and so sir ector hired him to teach his two sons kay could not sit still for lessons and he stopped coming but arthur listened with wide eyes he learned everything i bet you have guessed by now who that stranger was none other than merlin the magician at the end of each day when arthur finished his chores that was time for the lessons merlin would sit with arthur for hours and teach him about the world arthur was a thin lad not strong like his big brother kay merlin said not to worry about that he said what mattered most was to have a heart that was big and strong merlin saw how the foxes and deer followed arthur he could see that the boy had a very big and strong heartby the time arthur was his brother kay had become a knight he was now called sir kay arthur loved nothing more than to serve his brother as a squire he kept great care of his brothers tunic and helmet his spears and lancesmerlin saw how the foxes and deer followed arthur one day at lesson time merlin looked away he stood upwhat is it said arthurthe people need hope said merlin arthur there is something i must do i must go nowthat night when the nighttime was at its most dark merlin the magician came to londons market square he stood in the middle of the square he held both his arms high and pointed his wand to the starsthe next morning at dawn people started to arrive at the market there in front of them was something most odd a block of white marble stood in the middle of the town square resting on the block was a giant stone the size of a very large rock at the very top of the stone there was a golden sword handle and a few inches of the blade shining in the sun yet this was most odd the rest of the blade was buried deep into the stone none of this was there the day before there in front of them was something most odd whats more these words could be seen on the top of the bladewhoever pulls out this sword from this stone is the true king of englandas soon as the crowd knew about the message men jumped up to that white marble block one after another they gave the sword a yank each tried and tried but the sword stuck fast it would not moveone said in gloom there is no man alive who could pull out that swordwell see about that said a voice in the crowd the duke of cornwall dressed in silks and ribbons stepped up to the white marble block hear ye hear ye he said i call for a tournament to be held one month from today knights from anywhere and everywhere in england are invited to come there will be contests and prizes and a grand feast for all the duke said to his wife the duchess if i know men this tournament will draw the strongest finest knights in all of england said the duchess good idea my dear all we need is one knight who is so strong he can pull that sword from the stone then we will have a king again at lasti call for a tournament to be held one month from today the people danced and cheered at last there was something to feel happy about news of the tournament traveled fast from castle to village to every far corner of the land at last word got to the faraway home of sir ector sir kay heard the news when he was polishing his helmetarthur he called out arthur was by the woods feeding birds from his hand he set down a pile of seeds for the birds and a pile for the squirrels then he ran fast to see his brotherthere you are said kay there will be a tournament in london
