on a farm long ago a mama duck sat on her nest how long must i wait for my babies to hatch she said i have to sit here all alone and no one comes to visit me but what could she do a mama duck must keep her eggs warm till they hatch at last the eggs began to crack one by one yellow ducklings stepped out of their shells they shook their wings and said quack quacklook at all of you said mama duck with joy you are all so cutequack quack they saidmama duck said come and line up we will go down to the lake for your very first swim she counted one two three four five oh dear she said i should have six ducklingsbut one large egg was still in the nest well said mama duck it looks like that big egg will take more time so she had to go sit on her nest again and wait some morewell said mama duck it looks like that big egg will take more time the next day the big egg started to hatch out came a baby boy bird but if one may say so it was an oddlooking thing this bird was much bigger than others he was not yellow at all he was darkgray from his head to his feet and he walked with a funny wobbleone of the yellow ducklings pointed what is that he cannot be one of usi have never seen such an ugly duckling said another how can you say such a thing said mama duck in a stern voice you are only one day old your brother hatched from the very same nest as you did now line up we will go to the lake for your very first swimyet the other ducklings quacked ugly ugly ugly the ugly duckling did not know why the other ducklings were yelling at him he took the last spot in the linewhat is that he cannot be one of us each yellow duck jumped in the river and swam behind mama duck when it was his turn the ugly duckling jumped in and started to paddle too at least he can swim mama duck said to herselfwhen they left the water and started to play the ugly duckling tried to play with his brothers and sisters too they yelled go away we will not play with you you are ugly and you walk weird toowhen mama duck was close by she would not let them talk in this way be nice she would scold but she was not always close byone day one of the yellow ducklings said to the ugly duckling you know what you would do us a big favor if you just went away from here all of them started to quack get out get out get outwhy wont they let me stay here said the ugly duckling to himself he hung his head down low ah they are right i should goget out get out get out that night the ugly duckling flew over the farmyard fence he flew till he landed on the other side of the lake there he met two grownup duckscan i please stay here for awhile said the ugly duckling i have nowhere else to bewhat do we care said one of the ducks just dont get in our waywoof woof suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by chasing the two ducks they quickly flew up in the air and their feathers fell down on the ground the poor ugly duckling froze in fear the dog sniffed and sniffed at the ugly duckling then turned away i am too ugly even for the big hungry dog to want said the ugly duckling with his head hung lowthe sky turned dark crack a bolt of lightning then came a big storm with heavy rains pouring down from the sky in just moments the ugly duckling was soaked through and through then a cold wind started to blow suddenly a big hungry dog came tearing by chasing the two ducks brrr he said with both wings held close to his chest if only there was a place i could get dryall at once a tiny light blinked far off in the woods could it be someones huthe flew to the door quack said the ugly duckling the door of the hut creaked openwhat is all this noise said an old woman looking right and left her eyes were not that good then she looked down ah look at that its a duck she picked up the ugly duckling and dropped him inside her hut you can stay here but only if you lay eggs she saida tomcat and hen crept up to the ugly duckling who do you think you are coming in here and taking up room by the fire said the tomcat squawk said the hen i do not need anyone else in this hut laying eggsdo not worry about that said the ugly duckling i am a boy duckthen why are you still here said the tomcat did you not hear what the old woman saidget out of here pretender clucked the hen get out get out hissed the tomcatwhy are you still here said the tomcat the door was still a bit open so our poor ugly duckling slipped out the door and back into the stormno one ever wants me said the ugly duckling with a tear in his eye the storm ended soon he found a new lake looking into the water the ugly duckling saw the reflection of a flock of large white birds flying he looked overhead and could not believe what he saw there above him were the most beautiful birds he had ever seen their long white bodies and slender necks seemed to just glide through the sky he watched until the very last bird had winged its way out of view he stayed at that lake all by himself and time passed the leaves of the trees turned deep red and gold and then the leaves fell to the ground winter came setting a blanket of white snow all over the cold wind and the dark clouds made the ugly duckling feel even more sad he had to go into the cold cold lake to fish but it was getting harder to swim the lake was turning to ice one day it was all he could do was to paddle the water to keep it from freezing around him and trapping him in the lakei am so tired he said paddling with all his might the ice got thicker and drew closer to himin a moment two giant hands swept him up you poor thing said a farmer he held the ugly duckling close to his thick wool jacket and took the bird to his home you poor thing said a farmer never was a warm fireplace more welcome for the rest of the winter the farmer cared for the ugly duckling then spring came tips of green covered the trees short bright flowers popped up from the ground it is time for you to go to the lake to swim again as you were born to do said the farmer he took the duckling back to the lake where he had found him and set him with care on the watergosh i feel strong said the young bird flapping his wings why i never felt as strong as i do right nowhe heard quiet splashing sounds behind him and turned around a flock of those same beautiful birds he had seen in the sky before landed behind him on the waterdo not worry he said to them holding out one wing i will go now i will not make trouble for you a big fat tear rolled down his cheek he turned to go away when he opened his eyes he saw a reflection in the water of one of those beautiful white birds why was it so close to him he jumped back and the reflection jumped back too a big fat tear rolled down his cheek what is this he said he stretched his neck and the reflection of the beautiful bird stretched its neck toowhy are you going so soon said one of the beautiful birds stay here with us said another well be great friendsthen the bird who used to be the ugly duckling knew what had happened he was no longer an ugly gray bird that wobbled when it walked he was now a beautiful white swan at one moment all the swans flapped their wings and took off into the sky come with us one called back take the lead so he flapped his wings fast and took his place in front of the whole flock all his new friends flapped their wings behind himsay he said gliding and dipping through the sky as he sped on whos an ugly duckling now surely not i
