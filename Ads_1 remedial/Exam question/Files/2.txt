long ago in russia there lived a very rich nobleman the night before his first child was born the nobleman had a dream he dreamed the baby would be a boy and that the birth of the child came with an awful warning the only way his son would grow up in safety is if the childs feet never touched the ground until he was years oldafter the baby was born the nobleman made sure that his son was always held up high or he was placed in a spot high off the ground as the years passed and the boy grew bigger he was still watched carefully all the time by the castle servants to be sure his feet never touched the ground no matter if the boy was carried around or if he sat in a chair on a rug that could be pulled from room to room one way or another the boys feet never touched the floorfinally the boys th birthday drew near the day before the big day the castle servants were busy preparing for the celebration as usual the boy was held by the window where he could watch all the excitement deliveries of delicious fruits and meats were arriving along with people from far and wide who were coming to join in the celebration all of a sudden a very loud crash without thinking the nurse who was holding the boy dropped him on the floor the minute she realized what she had done she swept down to pick the boy back up but the child was nowhere to be seen the boys feet had touched the floor and now he was gonethe nurse screamed at once all the servants in the castle ran over the father ran up too asking what is the matter what has happened where is my son the nurse explained that she had been frightened by the crash and by mistake had let go of the boy she cried and wept in sadness for what she had doneno words can describe the sadness of the fathers heart he sent servants in every direction to hunt for the boy he gave orders he begged he threw away money left and right he promised everything anything if only his son might be brought back to him the servants searched and searched but no sign of the boy could be found he had disappeared without a trace as if he had never been there at allyears passed still no trace of the boy yet the father learned of something new at the stroke of midnight in one of the most beautiful rooms of the castle the sound of footsteps could be heard coming closer and closer he wished he could stay in the room to see if it was indeed his son but he could not bear the pain his heart still so weak after his sons disappearancethe nobleman sent word out throughout the land that a reward of gold coins would be given to anyone who would stay for the whole night in the haunted room many were willing but had not the courage to stay till the end when the clock struck midnight and the sound of footsteps was heard each person staying in the room would turn around in fear and run out of the castle as fast as they couldnow close to the castle there lived a widow who had three daughters the family was very poor it was not easy to keep enough food on the table when the family heard of the haunted room in the noblemans castle and the promised reward of gold pieces the oldest daughter said we have so little surely we have nothing to lose we might as well try to earn those gold coins by staying in the castle room for one night i would like to try mother if youll let methe mother hardly knew what to say she was worried of course because she had heard of the haunted room that had scared so many others away but when she thought of how poor they were with hardly enough food to go around she gave permission for her oldest

her eyes to the right flowed a river of liquid gold to the left rose high mountains of solid gold and in the center lay a large meadow covered with millions of flowers the stranger went on and the girl behind him followed unnoticed as he went he saluted the field flowers as old friendsthen they came to a forest where the trees were all of gold many birds flew around the young man landing on his head and shoulders while he spoke a thank you to each one the girl quietly broke off a branch from one of the golden trees and hid it as a reminder of this strange golden landleaving the forest of gold they reached a wood where all the trees were of silver animals of various kinds circled around the youth he spoke to each one thanking them for their kindness meanwhile the girl broke off a branch from one of the silver treeswhen the young boy had said goodbye to all his friends he turned and started to return by the paths he had come careful not to be seen the girl stepped behind him

the fireall my goodbyes have been said said the boy now we can have our supperthe girl placed the food she had cooked onto the table sitting side by side in front of the fire they enjoyed a meal together when they had finished he said now it is time to resthe lay down on the bed the girl placed by his side the gold and silver branches she had picked in the sparkling world she sat on a rocking chair by the fire in a few moments they were both sound asleepthe next day the sun was already high in the sky and yet the girl had not come out of the room as her two sisters had done the nobleman became worried what may have happened to the girl he paced the floor until he could do so no more at last he decided to go into the haunted room and see for himself what had happenedimagine his
